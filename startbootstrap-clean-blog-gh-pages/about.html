                        <p>My name is Katrina Michelle Pulido Lencioni. I was born and raised in Spanish Fork, Utah. I love my family, they are my favorite people. I have two sisters, one brother and 6 sibling-in-laws. I am an aunt to 3 adorable boys. I am married to Timpthy Lencioni. I met my husband 
                            my sophmore year of college at ward prayer. We were sealed for all eternity in the Mount Timpanogos temple in American Fork. My favorite hobbies include spending time with my family and friends, doing jigsaw puzzles, watching movies with my husband, and making lists. 
                            My favorite cuisine is peruvian food. I am peruvian-american; My dad is from Peru and my mom is from Utah, so I was born and raised in a blended family. I am a citizen of both America and Peru.I love my mixed culture and I feel it a privilege to have the 'Best of both Worlds'.
                            I love to travel and hope to travel the world with my family someday. </p>
                        <p>My college experience began with me studying Biodiversity and Convservation at Brigham Young University. I chose that major because I adore animals and wanted to take the path of a zoologist. As I studied biology, I realized I had no path moving forward and although I loved animals, this path was just not for me.
                            I went part time for 2.5 years because I needed to figure out what I wanted to do, and also because I wanted to work to make sure that I did not need to go into debt for school. Last year after signing up for a family finance class I realized my love for financing, budgeting and making lists. I know it is a strange interest
                            but I truly enjoy those things. As I started my prerequisites for the finance major, I realized that accounting was far more structured, organized and interesting for me. After taking FIN201 and ACC310 at BYU, I decided to go for the accounting major. I have enjoyed all the prerequisites for the class and am applying for the major this spring. 
                        </p>
                        <p>I am a hardworker, I love learning new things, I love to be able to apply things I learn to my life or to the real world. I am a very logical person, I like when things make sense. I like working and having a job, even if it is not the most fun job. I like the feeling of making my own money, and being good at my job. I like being dependable at work and for my family.</p>
